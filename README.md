#Yelp-data-analysis

The purpose of this exercise is to explore data provided by Yelp, the reviewing engine.  The businesses dataset used here contains information about businesses reviewed on yelp.
I employ a number of machine learning and statistical prediction methods in order to identify attributes of a restaurant that can help predict it's rating.  This exercise
is NOT intended to correctly predict a restaurant's rating given its attributes, but instead, glean actionable insights for prospective/current restauranteurs.

You can find the analysis in notebooks/yelp_explo.ipynb
